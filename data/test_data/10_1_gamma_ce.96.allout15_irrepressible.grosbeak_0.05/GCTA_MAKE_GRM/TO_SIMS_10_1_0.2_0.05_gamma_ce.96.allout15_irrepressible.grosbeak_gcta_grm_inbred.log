Calculating allele frequencies ...
Filtering SNPs with MAF > 0.05 ...
After filtering SNPs with MAF > 0.05, there are 33210 SNPs (0 SNPs with MAF < 0.05).
Recoding genotypes (individual major mode) ...

Calculating the genetic relationship matrix (GRM) ... (Note: default speed-optimized mode, may use huge RAM)

Summary of the GRM:
Mean of diagonals = 2
Variance of diagonals = 0.221252
Mean of off-diagonals = -0.0210525
Variance of off-diagonals = 0.0543052
